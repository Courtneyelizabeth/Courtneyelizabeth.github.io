              '--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.

              'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long
enough.'
            </p>
            <p>
              Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.
'What sort of people live about here?'
            </p>
            <p>
              'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives
a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March
Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'
            </p>

            <p>
              'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.
            </p>
            <p>
'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.
You're mad.
            </p>
            <p>
              'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.
            </p>
            <p>
'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'
            </p>
            <p>
              Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how

        do you know that you're mad?'
        </p>
        <p>
        'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?'
        </p>
        <p>
        'I suppose so,' said Alice.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,
and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and
wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'
        </p>
        <p>
'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?'
        </p>
        <p>
'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited
yet.'

          'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.

it suddenly appeared again.

          'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly
forgotten to ask.'
