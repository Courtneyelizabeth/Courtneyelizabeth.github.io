              and
    repeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
            </p>
            <p>
              The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, 'It was a treacle-well.'
            </p>
            <p>
              'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
yourself.'
            </p>
            <p>
'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I
dare say there may be ONE.'
            </p>
            <p>
              'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
go on. 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
you know--'
            </p>
            <p>
'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
            </p>
            <p>
'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
            </p>
            <p>
'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place
on.'

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took
the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from?'
        </p>
        <p>
'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'
        </p>
        <p>
          'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to
notice this last remark.
        </p>
        <p>
'Of course they were', said the Dormouse; '--well in.'
        </p>
        <p>
          This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of   things--everything that begins with an M--'
