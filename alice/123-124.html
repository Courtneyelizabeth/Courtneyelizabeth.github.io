            stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'
          </p>
          <p>
'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.
He was an old crab, HE was.'
          </p>
          <p>
            'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'
          </p>
          <p>
'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.
          </p>
          <p>
            'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to
change the subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so
on.'
          </p>
          <p>
            'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.
          </p>
          <p>
            'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked:
'because they lessen from day to day.'
          </p>
          <p>
            This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a
holiday?'

'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.
          </p>
          <p>
            'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.
          </p>
          <p>
'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided
tone: 'tell her something about the games now.'
