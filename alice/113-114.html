            uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.
          </p>
          <p>
            'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.
          </p>
          <p>
            ''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love,
'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'
          </p>
          <p>
            'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding
their own business!'
          </p>
          <p>
            'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral
of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves."'
          </p>
          <p>
'How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,'
the Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?'
          </p>
          <p>
            'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to

          Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock together."'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of
putting things!'
        </p>
        <p>
'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And
the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the less there is of
yours."'
        </p>
        <p>
'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,
'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that
is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put more
simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise."
