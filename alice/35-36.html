          'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in
your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.

        <p>
'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant
