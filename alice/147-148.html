newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts
at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court," and I never understood what it meant till now.'
          </p>
          <p>
'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the
King.
          </p>
          <p>
'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.'
          </p>
          <p>
'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.
          </p>
          <p>
Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
          </p>
          <p>
'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get
on better.'
          </p>
          <p>
'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the
Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
          </p>
          <p>
'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.
          </p>
          <p>
'--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

'Call the next witness!' said the King.
        </p>
        <p>
The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
        </p>
        <p>
'Give your evidence,' said the King.
        </p>
        <p>
'Shan't,' said the cook.
        </p>
        <p>
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'

'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'
        </p>
        <p>
'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.
        </p>
        <p>
'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.
