            it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And
then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!
          </p>
          <p>
'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and
help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)
          </p>
          <p>
            'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'
          </p>
          <p>
'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')
          </p>
          <p>
            'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!'
          </p>
          <p>
            'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'
          </p>
          <p>
            'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a

          number of
cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do
next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm
sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'
        </p>
        <p>
          She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices
all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other
ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!
fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em
together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll
do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this
rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming
down! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I
fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I
won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to
go down the chimney!'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to
herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I THINK I can kick a little!'
        </p>
        <p>
          She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited
till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort
