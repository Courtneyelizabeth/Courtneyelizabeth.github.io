            'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've
begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the
March Hare.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Exactly so,' said Alice.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.
          </p>
          <p>
            'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I
say--that's the same thing, you know.'
          </p>
          <p>
'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say
that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!'
          </p>
          <p>
'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what I
get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'
          </p>
          <p>
            'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing
as "I sleep when I breathe"!'
          </p>
          <p>
            'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
thought over all she could remember about ravens and

          writing-desks, which wasn't much.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month
is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'
        </p>
        <p>
'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit
the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
        </p>
        <p>
'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:
'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,
you know.'
        </p>
        <p>
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a
funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
tell what o'clock it is!'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you
