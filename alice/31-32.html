          At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you
dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse
in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

        <p>
          'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! "William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much

          'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.

          'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.
        </p>

'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. "Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,
the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--"'

        <p>
'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what
"it" means.'
        </p>
        <p>

archbishop find?'
