            At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
          </p>
          <p>
'--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.
          </p>
          <p>
'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first
question, you know.'
          </p>
          <p>
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really
dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.
It's enough to drive one crazy!'
          </p>
          <p>
            The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for
days and days.'
          </p>
          <p>
'But what am I to do?' said Alice.
          </p>
          <p>
'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's

perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in
the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
        </p>
        <p>
'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,
as well as she could for sneezing.
        </p>

        <p>
There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess
sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on
the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
        </p>

          'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why
