      <p>
        The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
her in a languid, sleepy voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know
who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.'
      </p>
      <p>
'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain
yourself!'

          'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not
myself, you see.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,
'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you
have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
queer, won't you?'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know
is, it would feel very queer to ME.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,
