'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
'--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'
          </p>
          <p>
'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.
          </p>
          <p>
'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.
          </p>
          <p>
'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you
take me for a dunce? Go on!'
          </p>
          <p>
'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after
that--only the March Hare said--'
          </p>
          <p>
'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
          </p>
          <p>
'You did!' said the Hatter.
          </p>
          <p>
'I deny it!' said the March Hare.
          </p>
          <p>
'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'

'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'
        </p>
        <p>
'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.
        </p>
        <p>
'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.
        </p>
        <p>
'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'
        </p>
        <p>
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.
        </p>
        <p>
'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.

Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
