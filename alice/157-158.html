Don't let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.'
      </p>
      <p>
'That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the
King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--'
      </p>
      <p>
'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large
in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting
him,) 'I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of
meaning in it.
      </p>
      <p>
The jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an
atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.
      </p>
      <p>
'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'
he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them
with one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID
I COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the
Knave.
      </p>
      <p>
The Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he
certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)

'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over
the verses to himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of
course--"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know--'
        </p>
        <p>
'But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.
        </p>
        <p>
'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts
on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE
HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the
Queen.
        </p>
        <p>
'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as
it lasted.)
        </p>
        <p>
'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court
with a smile. There was a dead silence.
        </p>
        <p>
'It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,
'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the
twentieth time that day.
        </p>
        <p>
'No, no!' said the Queen. 'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'
