        'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!'
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and
they walked off together.

        Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had

        'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
        though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very
        well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,'
        she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of
        rule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes
        them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children
        sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so
        stingy about it, you know--'

          She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.'

'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only
you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
she spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an
