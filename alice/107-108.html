            'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'
He got behind Alice as he spoke.
          </p>
          <p>
            'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book,
but I don't remember where.'
          </p>
          <p>
            'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed!'
          </p>
          <p>
            The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.
'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.
          </p>
          <p>
            'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he
hurried off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was
            going
  on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with
  passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be

executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the
other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless
sort of way to fly up into a tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't
matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a
large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.
