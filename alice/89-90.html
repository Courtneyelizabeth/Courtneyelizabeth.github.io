'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We
quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing
with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

          <p id="talking">
            "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
    How I wonder what you're at!"
          </p>
          <p>
            You know the song, perhaps?'
          </p>
          <p>
            'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.
          </p>
          <p>
'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--
          </p>
          <p id="talking">
     "Up above the world you fly,
     Like a tea-tray in the sky.
         Twinkle, twinkle--"'
          </p>
          <p>
            Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch
it to make it stop.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the

'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.
        </p>
        <p>
          'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't
do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'
        </p>
        <p>
          A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?' she asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time,
and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'
