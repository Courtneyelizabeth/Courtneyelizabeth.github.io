        'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words
have got altered.'
      </p>
      <p>
        'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and
there was silence for some minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
'What size do you want to be?' it asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one
doesn't like changing so often, you know.'
      </p>
      <p>
        'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
      </p>
      <p>
'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p>
'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'
said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'

          'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
        </p>
        <p>
          'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And
she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
offended!'
        </p>
        <p>
'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In
a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth
and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself.
        </p>
        <p>
'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
