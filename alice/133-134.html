            then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,
            and said 'That's very curious.'
          </p>
          <p>
            'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.
          </p>
          <p>
            'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'I
            should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
            begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
            authority over Alice.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said the
            Gryphon.
          </p>
          <p>
            'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'
            thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, she
            got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
            Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
            very queer indeed:--
          </p>
          <p id="talking">
            ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.

          [later editions continued as follows
  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
        </p>
        <p>
          'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the
  Gryphon.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds
          uncommon nonsense.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
          wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.
        </p>
        <p>
          'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next
          verse.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them
          out with his nose, you know?'
        </p>
        <p>
          'It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully
          puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
