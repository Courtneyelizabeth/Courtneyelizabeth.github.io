'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.
          </p>
          <p>
'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.
          </p>
          <p>
'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a
memorandum of the fact.
          </p>
          <p>
'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of
my own. I'm a hatter.'
          </p>
          <p>
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.
          </p>
          <p>
'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have
you executed on the spot.'
          </p>
          <p>
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in
his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was

the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her

'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'
        </p>
        <p>
'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'
        </p>
        <p>
'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.
        </p>
        <p>
'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing
too.'
        </p>
        <p>
'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that
ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
other side of the court.
        </p>
        <p>
All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on
which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.

'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you
