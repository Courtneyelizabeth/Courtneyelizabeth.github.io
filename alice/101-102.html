          gardeners, or soldiers, or
courtiers, or three of her own children.
        </p>
        <p>
          'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 'It's no
business of MINE.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
silent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my
dear: she is only a child!'
        </p>
        <p>
          The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them
over!'
        </p>
        <p>
          The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
        </p>
        <p>
'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.
        </p>
        <p>
'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'

          'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--'
        </p>
        <p>
'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.
        </p>
        <p>
'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted
in reply.
        </p>
        <p>
          'That's right!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?'
        </p>
        <p>
          The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Yes!' shouted Alice.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.
