        trying which word sounded best.
      </p>
      <p>
Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.
      </p>
      <p>
At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule
Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'
      </p>
      <p>
Everybody looked at Alice.
      </p>
      <p>
'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.
      </p>
      <p>
'You are,' said the King.
      </p>
      <p>
'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
      </p>
      <p>
'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.'
      </p>
      <p>
'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
      </p>
      <p>
'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your
verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
        </p>
        <p>
'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White
Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked
up.'
        </p>
        <p>
'What's in it?' said the Queen.
        </p>
        <p>
'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'
        </p>
        <p>
'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to
nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'
        </p>
        <p>
'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.
        </p>
        <p>
'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's
nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and
added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'
        </p>
        <p>
'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen.
        </p>
        <p>
'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing
about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)
