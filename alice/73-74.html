            your cat grins like that?'
          </p>
          <p>
'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'
          </p>
          <p>
            She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--
          </p>
          <p>
            'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know
that cats COULD grin.'
          </p>
          <p>
'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'
          </p>
          <p>
            'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'
          </p>
          <p>
            Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was

          howling so much already,
          that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in
an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually
large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.
        </p>
        <p>
          'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'
        </p>
        <p>

'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get
an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of
what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes
twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'
        </p>
        <p>
'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is
it twelve? I--'
        </p>
        <p>
'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'
And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of
lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of
