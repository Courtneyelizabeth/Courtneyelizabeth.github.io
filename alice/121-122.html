            'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'
          </p>
          <p>
            'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud
as all that.'
          </p>
          <p>
            'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'
          </p>
          <p>
            'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in
a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,
"French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'
          </p>
          <p>
            'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of
the sea.'
          </p>
          <p>
            'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I
only took the regular course.'
          </p>
          <p>
            'What was that?' inquired Alice.
          </p>

          'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle
replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'
        </p>
        <p>
'I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'
        </p>
        <p>
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of
uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'
        </p>
        <p>
'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,
you ARE a simpleton.'
        </p>
        <p>
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off
the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'What was THAT like?' said Alice.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too
