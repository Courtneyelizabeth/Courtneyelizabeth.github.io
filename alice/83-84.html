        There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
suppose it doesn't mind.'
      </p>
      <p>
        The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they

          saw Alice coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
        </p>
        <p>
Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.
        </p>
        <p>
          'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.
        </p>
        <p>
'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.
        </p>
        <p>
'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said
the March Hare.
        </p>
        <p>
'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great
many more than three.'
        </p>
        <p>
'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice
for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.
        </p>
        <p>
          'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some
severity; 'it's very rude.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID
was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'
