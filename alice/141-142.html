One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

          <p>
'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.
          </p>
          <p>
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--
          </p>
          <p>
'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!'
          </p>
          <p>
'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.
          </p>
          <p>
'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great
deal to come before that!

'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'
        </p>
        <p>
The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one
hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your
Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished
my tea when I was sent for.'
        </p>

'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'
        </p>
        <p>
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it
was,' he said.
        </p>
        <p>
'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.
        </p>
        <p>
'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.
        </p>
        <p>
'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and
