'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury
all brightened up again.)
      </p>
      <p>
'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they
can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'
      </p>

'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter
worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your
name like an honest man.'
      </p>
      <p>
There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day.
      </p>
      <p>
'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.
      </p>
      <p>
'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even know
what they're about!'
      </p>
      <p>
'Read them,' said the King.

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty?' he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you
come to the end: then stop.'
        </p>
        <p>
These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--
        </p>
        <p id="talking">
'They told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him:
 She gave me a good character, But said I could not swim.
        </p>
        <p id="talking">
  He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true):
  If she should push the matter on, What would become of you?
        </p>
        <p id="talking">
I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more;
 They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before.
        </p>
        <p id="talking">
          If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair,
  He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were.
        </p>
        <p id="talking">
  My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit)
  An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it.
        </p>
