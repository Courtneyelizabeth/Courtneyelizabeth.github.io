            yawning.
'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.'
          </p>
          <p>
            'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.
          </p>
          <p>
'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And
they pinched it on both sides at once.
          </p>
          <p>
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'
          </p>
          <p>
'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.
          </p>
          <p>
'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.
          </p>
          <p>
            'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again
before it's done.'
          </p>
          <p>
            'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began
in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well--'
          </p>
          <p>
'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in
questions of eating and drinking.

          'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.
        </p>
        <p>
'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd
have been ill.'
        </p>
        <p>
'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But
why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
        </p>
        <p>
'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't
take more.'
        </p>
        <p>
'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take
MORE than nothing.'
        </p>
        <p>
'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse,
