        <section>
          <p>
            every line:
          </p>
          <p id="talking">
            'Speak roughly to your little boy,
            And beat him when he sneezes:
            He only does it to annoy,
            Because he knows it teases.'
          </p>
          <p>
             CHORUS.
          </p>
          <p>
 (In which the cook and the baby joined):--
          </p>
          <p id="talking">
             'Wow! wow! wow!'
          </p>
          <p>
            While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:--
          </p>
          <p id="talking">
            'I speak severely to my boy,
            I beat him when he sneezes;
            For he can thoroughly enjoy
            The pepper when he pleases!'
          </p>
          <p>
            CHORUS.
          </p>
          <p id="talking">
            'Wow! wow! wow!
          </p>

          'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw
a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
        </p>
        <p>
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just
like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting
like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and
straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute
or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
        </p>
        <p>
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried
it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'
thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be
murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself.'
