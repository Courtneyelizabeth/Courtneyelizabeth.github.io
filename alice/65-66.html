        'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those
serpents! There's no pleasing them!'
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
      </p>
      <p>
        'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon;
'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'
      </p>
      <p>
        'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from
the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'
      </p>
      <p>
'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--'
      </p>
      <p>
'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying to
invent something!'
      </p>
      <p>
        'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
      </p>

        <p>
          'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE
with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use
denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an
egg!'
        </p>
        <p>
          'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're
a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'
        </p>
        <p>
          This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're
looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me
whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'
        </p>
        <p>
          'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking
for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't
like them raw.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
