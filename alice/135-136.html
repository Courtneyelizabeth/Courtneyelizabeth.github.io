            'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it
            begins "I passed by his garden."'
          </p>
          <p>
            Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
  wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--
          </p>
          <p id="talking">
            'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
            How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'
          </p>
          <p id="talking">
              [later editions continued as follows
              The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
              While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
              When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
              Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
              While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
              And concluded the banquet--]
          </p>
          <p>
            'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle
            interrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most
            confusing thing I ever heard!'
          </p>
          <p>
            'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was
            only too glad to do so.
          </p>

          'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went
          on. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice
  replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
  'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, old
  fellow?'
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
          with sobs, to sing this:--
        </p>
        <p id="talking">
            'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,Waiting in a hot tureen!
            Who for such dainties would not stoop?Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
            Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!  Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
            Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
            Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
        </p>
        <p id="talking">
          'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish, Game, or any other dish?
          Game, or any other dish?  Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
          Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
          Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
