        very gravely, 'I think,
you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'

      <p>
        'Why?' said the Caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important
to say!'
      </p>
      <p>
        This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
      </p>
      <p>
'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.
      </p>
      <p>
        'No,' said the Caterpillar.
      </p>

        Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and

          So you think
you're changed, do you?'

'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I
used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it all came

          And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
          Do you think, at your age, it is right?'
