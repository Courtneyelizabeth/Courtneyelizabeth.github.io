Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

            '"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
 "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
 The further off from England the nearer is to France--
 Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
          </p>
          <p id="talking">
            Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
            Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"'
          </p>
          <p>
            'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling
            very glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious song
            about the whiting!
          </p>
          <p>
            'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, 'they--you've seen them,
            of course?'
          </p>
          <p>
            'Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she checked herself
            hastily.

          'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, 'but if you've
          seen them so often, of course you know what they're like.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. 'They have their tails in
          their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all
          wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the
          reason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her
          about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.
        </p>
        <p>
          'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters
to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long
way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get
them out again. That's all.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much
          about a whiting before.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you
          know why it's called a whiting?'
        </p>
        <p>
          'I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'
        </p>
        <p>
          'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.
