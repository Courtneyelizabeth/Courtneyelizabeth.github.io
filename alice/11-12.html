        trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.

        Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

        Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not

into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it
would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could
shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.'
For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
impossible.

            There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
    back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
    any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
    time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here
    before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
    label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large
    letters.

          It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was
not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see
