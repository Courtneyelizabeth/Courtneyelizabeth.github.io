        <p>There was the time 3-year-old Alex (he is number 4 in a line of 5 kids)
          was in the bath tub, the timer on my oven went off and he was out of the
          tub in a flash.

          When I caught up with him he was standing next to the oven, holding
          his little arm straight up in order to keep my oven mitt on.
        </p>
        <p>He had an expectant look on his face. It hit me as I reached
          over the burners to turn off the timer, he was waiting for cookies.
