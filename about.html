<!--<h2 class="feature">a little bit more about me...</h2>
	<p>I've been married to my funny, supportive and loving husband for little over a year.</p>
	<p>Some of my happiest moments are moments spent in the mountains. I can't get enough of what they provide.</p>
	<p>I have 5 brothers whom I adore. They always get me outside to toss a football or throw a snowball.</p>
	<p>Having a smooth cup of coffee with a piece of dark chocolate is pure comfort for me. Pablo's and Aviano in Denver are my go to coffee spots.</p>
	<p>Traveling is in my blood...I love exploring the world and spontaneous getaways with my husband.</p>
