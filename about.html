<aside class="about">
<p>I'm Courtney, a web designer and on-location natural light photographer in Denver, Colorado. I specialize in developing websites for photographers and small local businesses (if you aren't local we can still chat and possibly work something out). My passion is focused on creating your website beautifully.</p>


			<p>I hope you feel a connection to my work and if it speaks to you, let's meet over coffee and discuss designing your website.<br></p>

<h2 class="feature">a little bit more about me...</h2>
	<p>I've been married to my funny, supportive and loving husband for little over a year. I can't imagine a life without him in it.</p>
	<p>Some of my happiest moments are moments spent in the mountains. I can't get enough of what they provide.</p>
	
	<p>I have 5 brothers whom I adore. They always get me outside to toss a football or throw a snowball.</p>
	<p>Having a smooth cup of coffee with a piece of dark chocolate is pure comfort for me. Pablo's and Aviano in Denver are my go to coffee spots.</p>
	<p>Traveling is in my blood...I love exploring the world and spontaneous getaways with my husband.</p>
