<h2 class="feature">Me</h2>
<p class="about">Hi! I'm Courtney, a web designer and on-location natural light photographer. I specialize in developing websites for photographers and small local businesses (if you aren't local, we can still chat and possibly work something out). My passion and work is focused on showing your passion and work beautifully. I believe that a website shows personality, has an overall feeling and a first impression. A website should be individualized to relect your business and vision. I would love to design a website that is personalized to your business.</p>
<h2 class="feature">Things that make me happy</h2>
<div class="about">
	<ul>
	<li>My funny, supportive and loving husband. I can't imagine a life without him in it.</li>
	<li>The Mountains. I cannot get enough of the mountains. Ever.</li>
	<li> My family. I adore my 5 brothers. They have and always will get me outside to toss a football or throw a snowball.</li>
	<li>Coffee. Smooth chocolaty coffee. Pablo's and Aviano in Denver are my favorites.</li>
	<li> Travel. I love seeing what's out there.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I would love to build a website that captures your passion and business.

If you feel like I could be a good fit, feel free to contact me. We can chat over coffee... or tea.<br></p>
